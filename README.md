Our project is a Health-based application that assists the user in firstly diagnosing what potential condition they may have, and secondly in directing them to the nearest facility that is suited to their selected condition.

We do this by firstly asking the user to provide at least three symptoms from an extensive list. We then take some basic details - their age, gender and a maximum radius of results to obtain from the user's current location. The application then asks the user three questions relating to their symptoms, to determine a list of potential conditions. The information that lists potential symptoms to the user and helps to diagnose the users condition based on the symptoms and answers it is supplied is obtained via API calls to Infermedica. The diagnosis the user selects is then mapped to a certain kind of facility, e.g. a dentist for a user with a toothache, and this information is fed into Google Maps API, which determines suitable facilities within the radius input by the user and displays them on a map, as well as the user's current location.
